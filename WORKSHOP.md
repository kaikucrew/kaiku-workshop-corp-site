# Exercise 1: Building with AI 

The exercise serves as the introduction to AI assisted software development, covering key concepts, terms and approaches.

## Goals

- Experience coding through agents and see alternate ways of working.

- Learn how to manage context and interact with the agents.

- Understand the benefits and limitations of development agents.

- See how to tailor and steer agents to get the most value out of them.

> [!NOTE]
> These instructions as well as the documentation, code and project issues are vague in some areas. This is intentional as it forces more or a reliance on agents & AI to work through the exercises in the time. Try to complete objectives throught the development agent, asking questions as you go.  

## Steps

1. Clone this repository: https://github.com/kaikucrew/kaiku-workshop-corp-site

2. Get the project started and setup


3. Check the issues for work items https://github.com/kaikucrew/kaiku-workshop-corp-site/issues

4. Start building the rules and context to code together with an agent.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a [.cheats/](.cheats/) directory that includes some preformatted context that can assist in working with the agents, but try to work with it on your own first.
